# oker
A version of Rust's Result type in Typescript, which can be Ok or Err (oker)

This package is early development and is subject to change at any time!

For documentation and usage examples, consult the JSDoc in `src/index.ts`.
Eventually I'd like to have the documentation in Markdown form (here in the
README or somehwere else), but until I decide how I want to write or otherwise
generate that Markdown the JSDoc is the primary source for information.
